- **Stakeholders:** To understand the capabilities and limitations of the platform.

#### 1.3 Goals

- Develop a robust and scalable social media platform with core functionalities.
- Provide a hands-on learning experience in advanced Java, Spring Boot, and related technologies.
- Deepen understanding of data structures (HashMaps, Trees, Graphs, Heaps) and algorithms in a real-world context.
- Gain practical experience in designing and implementing distributed systems, including microservices, caching, and message queues.
- Implement a comprehensive API layer for client interaction.
- Establish a foundation for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) practices.

- Follow/Unfollow Functionality
- Post Creation (Text, Images)
- Likes and Comments on Posts
- Personalized Timeline/Feed Generation
- Real-time Notifications
- User and Post Search
- Scalable RESTful APIs
- Basic Admin Dashboard for metrics

#### 2.3 User Personas

- **User Alice (Active Socializer):** Regularly posts content, interacts with friends' posts, follows many accounts, and expects a real-time feed and notifications.
- **User Bob (Casual Browser):** Primarily consumes content, occasionally likes or comments, uses search to find interesting topics or users.
- **Admin Carol (System Overseer):** Monitors system health, user activity, and performance metrics.

#### 2.4 Operating Environment

- **Operating System:** Linux-based environments (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS) for deployment. Development can be on Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Cloud Platform:** Designed for deployment on cloud providers (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).
- **Runtime Environment:** Java Virtual Machine (JVM) 17+.
- **Database:** Relational (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB for specific use cases).
- **Caching:** Redis.
- **Message Broker:** Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ.

  - **Algorithms:** Hashing functions for efficient key-value lookups.
- **Trees (e.g., B-Trees, Trie):**
  - **Usage:** Database indexing (B-Trees for efficient data retrieval), prefix-based search for usernames/hashtags (Trie).
  - **Algorithms:** Tree traversal, insertion, deletion, search.
- **Graphs:**
  - **Usage:** Representing user relationships (follow/unfollow network). Finding mutual followers, or recommending new users to follow (social graph analysis).
  - **Algorithms:** Breadth-First Search (BFS) for finding friends of friends, Depth-First Search (DFS), shortest path algorithms for relationship analysis.
- **Heaps (Min/Max Heap):**
  - **Usage:** Prioritizing notifications (e.g., most urgent first), implementing a "trending topics" feature based on recency and engagement.
  - **Algorithms:** Heapify, insert, extract-min/max.
- **Caches (Distributed Cache like Redis):**
  - **Usage:**
    - **User Sessions:** Storing JWTs and associated user data for quick authentication checks.
    - **Feed Caching:** Caching pre-generated timelines for highly active users.
    - **Post Caching:** Caching popular posts or recently viewed posts.
    - **User Profile Caching:** Caching frequently accessed user profiles to reduce database load.

    - **Cache-Aside:** For simple read-heavy scenarios.
    - **Least Recently Used (LRU):** For eviction policies.
- **Queues (Message Queues like Kafka/RabbitMQ):**
  - **Usage:** Asynchronous processing of tasks:
    - Generating notifications (decouple from post creation).
    - Image processing/resizing after upload.
    - Updating follower/following counts.
    - Feed generation in a fan-out on write model.
  - **Algorithms:** Producer-consumer model, FIFO.
- **Sorting Algorithms:**
  - **Usage:** Sorting posts by recency for timeline, sorting search results by relevance.
